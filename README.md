# patchTeam

patch.team is a web app that allows broadcast audio professionals
to communicate complex information to team members, in a clear dynamic
format.

This project was created to learn and patch.team was created with only a basic understanding of programming, the best way to lean is to build something, right? So from a real world problem to a deployed solution, my  progression can be seen in the code. All the code here is written by me, with only help from the usual sources - Google, GitHub, Stackoverflow etc. No outside human help was recieved. 

It is deployed on AWS Elastic Beastalk.
